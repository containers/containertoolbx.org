## Builder

Builder is the IDE of choice for GNOME developers. It had the [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org) integration designed from the get go, to easily develop and deploy desktop class applications. 

It also features **Toolbx** configuration workflows, allowing you to run and test apps or system components outside of the host system.

GNOME shell developers are [using toolbx](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/tree/main/tools/toolbox?ref_type=heads) for example.
