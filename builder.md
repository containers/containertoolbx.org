## Builder

Builder is the IDE of choice for GNOME developers. It had the [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org) integration designed from the get go, to easily develop and deploy desktop class applications. It also features **Toolbx** workflows for developing system components, such as the [GNOME shell](https://blogs.gnome.org/shell-dev/).

FIXME: screenshots and walkthrough with the gnome-shell scripts.
